/**
 * @brief Reads the analog values from the joystick potentiometers and returns them as a Positions struct.
 *
 * This function reads the analog input values from the joystick's potentiometers on the specified pins,
 * maps the values to a range of -100 to 100 for the angular axis and 100 to -100 for the radial axis, 
 * and applies a deadband to eliminate small fluctuations around the center.
 *
 * @return Positions - a struct containing the mapped and processed values of the angular and radial joystick positions.
 * 
 * The deadband ensures that values near the center of the joystick are treated as zero to account for 
 * measurement noise and prevent unintended small movements.

 * @brief Precomputes and returns points approximating a straight line between two positions in polar coordinates.
 *
 * This function precomputes an array of points that approximate a straight line by interpolating between two 
 * end points specified in cartesian coordinates, then converts them to polar coordinates. It stores these points 
 * in a static array and returns the next point on each function call, allowing efficient streaming of precomputed 
 * line points. The line is divided into a specified number of segments (resolution), with a maximum of 100 points.
 *
 * @param point0 The starting point of the line, specified in radial and angular steps.
 * @param point1 The ending point of the line, specified in radial and angular steps.
 * @param current The current position of the gantry, used to calculate relative motion if needed.
 * @param resolution The number of segments to divide the line into, defaulting to 100 and capped at 100.
 * @param reset Bool - set true to force recalculation for a new line.
 *
 * @return Positions The next point along the precomputed line, with radial and angular values in steps.
 *
 * @note The function handles vertical lines by temporarily rotating the points 90 degrees to avoid calculation 
 * issues, then rotates them back before returning. The line is broken into segments up to the maximum length of 
 * the array, and lines close to the center of the field are handled with a higher resolution to maintain accuracy.
 *
 * @details The first call to this function precomputes all points along the line, and subsequent calls return 
 * each point in sequence. The function resets for a new line after the last point is returned.

 * @brief Generates the vertices of a regular n-sided polygon (n-gon) and stores them in an array of Positions.
 *
 * This function computes the vertices of a regular polygon (n-gon) with a specified number of sides, radius, 
 * center point, and optional rotation. The vertices are generated in polar coordinates, with the first vertex 
 * starting at angle 0 (or rotated by the specified degrees) and are then translated to be centered around the 
 * specified center point. The generated points are stored in the provided pointArray.
 *
 * @param pointArray A pointer to the array of Positions to be filled with the vertices of the polygon.
 * @param numPoints The number of vertices (or sides) of the polygon.
 * @param centerPoint The center point of the polygon, specified as a Positions struct (radial and angular coordinates).
 * @param radius The radius of the polygon, which is the distance from the center to each vertex (in motor steps).
 * @param rotationDeg An optional rotation of the polygon in degrees, defaulting to 0.0. This rotates the polygon around its center.
 *
 * @return void
 *
 * @note The function first generates the vertices centered on the origin in polar coordinates, then translates 
 * them to the specified center point by converting to rectangular coordinates, performing the translation, and 
 * converting back to polar. The translatePoints() function is used to handle this translation process.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of generating an octagon with a radius of 4000 steps centered on the origin:
 * int numberVertices = 8;
 * Positions vertices[numberVertices];
 * Position center = {0, 0};
 * nGonGenerator(vertices, numberVertices, center, 4000, 0.0);
 *
 * // Example of generating a circle with 360 points and a radius of 2000 steps, centered at {3000, 60 degrees}:
 * int numberVertices = 360;
 * Positions vertices[numberVertices];
 * Position center = {3000, convertDegreesToSteps(60)};
 * nGonGenerator(vertices, numberVertices, center, 2000, 0.0);

/**
 * @brief Translates an array of points along a given translation vector, shifting their position in polar coordinates.
 *
 * This function translates the points in the pointArray by converting both the points and the provided 
 * translation vector from polar to rectangular coordinates, performing the translation, and then converting 
 * the points back to polar coordinates. It is useful for shifting polygons or target positions by a specified 
 * offset. For example, this function can be used to shift the center of a polygon generated by nGonGenerator().
 *
 * @param pointArray A pointer to an array of points (of type Positions) representing the points to be translated.
 * @param numPoints The number of points in the array.
 * @param translationVector The translation vector to shift the points by, specified as a Positions struct.
 *
 * @return void - the array is modified directly because it is passed into this function as a pointer.
 *
 * @note The translation is performed by first converting the points and translation vector to rectangular 
 * coordinates (x, y), adding the corresponding components, and then converting the updated points back to 
 * polar coordinates (r, Î¸). This ensures that the points are translated accurately in both radial and angular 
 * dimensions. The function assumes the angular component of the translation vector is in steps, and the 
 * radial component is in motor steps.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example usage to shift a polygon to a new center:
 * Positions vertices[8];
 * Positions translationVector = {3500, convertDegreesToSteps(45)};
 * nGonGenerator(vertices, 8, {0, 0}, 4000, 0.0);
